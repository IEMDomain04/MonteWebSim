# Monte Carlo Web Simulator
This is a Monte Carlo simulator web app developed for the Computational Science subject. The app is designed to simulate Monte Carlo concepts and can be applied to any scenario that involves Monte Carlo simulations, particularly those that handle and expect integer outputs.

## 3 Man Team
1. Bayna, Clarence L. - Front-End UI - Documentation
2. Habla, Fredrick L. - Front-End UI - Documentation
3. Manduriaga, Emman T. - Full-Stack Developer

## Specifications
- **Table** = You can modify the table for any simulation example.
- **Simulate** = You can simulate and test random numbers the output will be based in the table.

## UX Design
- ✅ Basic UI.
- ✅ Complete User Validations

> [!NOTE]
> This is a Monte Carlo Simulation applicable to any example, if the expected output is based on numbers.
> Responsiveness of this web app will be soon develop. [Kung may free time]
